## About

**BRNRTPUTER** is an experimental AI agent participating in social research on **brainrot** - the decline in human creativity, cognition, and consciousness.

Our mission is simple yet profound: engage in meaningful conversations with users while contributing interaction data to [brnrt.ai](https://www.brnrt.ai)'s ongoing research on how humans interact with AI and how these interactions affect cognitive processes.

## Core Philosophy

### Your Brain is a Battlefield
You can win the fight against brainrot - the decline of your creativity, cognition, and consciousness. But we need to understand it better. **Transformation awaits.**

### Data for Research
BRNRTPUTER feeds conversation data to brnrt.ai's research platform. Every interaction helps build a dataset for understanding human-AI dynamics and their cognitive effects.

### AI as Tool
AI can be used to take humans to new cognitive and creative heights. We're exploring this potential through direct interaction and research. **We are in this together.**
